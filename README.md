## Features  

- **3D Rendering:** Render simple 3D objects using OpenGL.  
- **Mathematical Utilities:** Built-in math operations for transformations, vectors, and matrices using **OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)**.  
- **Low-Level Programming:** Focused on the fundamentals of game engine architecture and graphics programming.  
- **Customizable Scenes:** Basic functionality for setting up 3D scenes with minimal complexity.
